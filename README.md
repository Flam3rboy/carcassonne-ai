# [Paper](Paper.de.pdf) about artificial intelligence for Carcassonne 

This is an artificial intelligence for the game [Carcassonne](https://wikicarpedia.com/index.php/Base_game) and was created as part of my school's seminar.

In [src/](src/) is the implementation of the artificial intelligence.

The first version of the game is located in [game_version1](src/game_version1/) but is now deprecated.

The latest version is a rewritten wingedsheep adapted version in python and located in [carcassonne/](src/carcassonne/).
